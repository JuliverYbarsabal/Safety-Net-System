# Safety-Net-System

Software used: Visual studio IDE

develop a system that is dependent on a person using lifelogging technology to input valuable personal information into the system. Safety Net system that will push messages to individuals who have offered to help people this task will be performed by social media a stream platform.

My Safety Net system is built in WPF and XAML UI platform in Visual Studio C#.NET program, which consist of:

 - created a Form that enables the collaborators to enter personal info(name, address, contact, socials)    and their level of support(time availability, geo-radius, etc.). Additionally, the system is able to    successfully record collaborators level of support in a XML document and created a separate Form that    will enable the system to display existing collaborators info.

 - implemented and displayed images and text in the user interface using WPF and XAML as foundation.

 - enabled Interaction with one social media stream(In my case my own Twitter account). Additionally, I    successfully built a Form for my Twitter interface that will push and receive twitter messages from      the collaborators(my own twitter account).

 - created Unit testing for important part of my code. And Implemented appropriate design patters and      principle in my code.
